### Your Mission

Your mission is to modernize your application and development practices, from green screen to a collaborative git/VS Code era with DevOps automation ðŸ˜„ .  The ARCAD-EXAMPLE application will be used.

Merlin can support any kind of build mechanisms (like GNU make, or BoB).  As the example application is a complex application, the decision was made to use Merlin with its powerful Arcad Software features.  The example application is already initialized in Merlin/Arcad.

You are part of a team developers on-boarded on Merlin.  Each developer will work on the same arcad-example application on distinct branches.

The application source members have already been migrated from QSYS.LIB to a git repository, managed by Merlin as an Arcad Project.  Webhooks are configured on Git so every action in git is caught by Merlin/Arcad Builder.
