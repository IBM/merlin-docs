### Your Mission

Your mission is to modernize your application and development practices, from green screen to a collaborative git/VS Code era with DevOps automation ðŸ˜„

Merlin can support any kind of build mechanisms (like GNU make, or BoB) but as it is a complex application, decision was made to use Merlin with its powerful Arcad Software features.  ARCAD-EXAMPLE app is already initialized in Merlin/Arcadâ€¦

You are part of a team of 12 developers, on-boarded on Merlin: team1 to 12, all working on the same arcad-example application, on distinct branches feature/teamXX (XX = 1 to 12).

The Application source members have already been migrated from QSYS.LIB to a git repository, managed by Merlin as an Arcad Project.  Webhooks are configured on Git so every action in git is caught by Merlin/Arcad Builder.
