# Merlin Test Drive

It is now possible to try Merlin (and all components) for a limited timeframe,  leveraging the new Merlin Test Drive environment.

The Merlin Test Drive environment provides access to:

* A dedicated IBM i LPAR
* Pre-configured instance of Merlin
* CICD pipeline

With access to the Merlin Test Drive environment, this hands-on documentation can be used to understand how Merlin, Merlin IDE and Merlin CICD works. During the alloted timeframe you are given, IBM will provide support so you can ask any questions you might have about Merlin.

#### Value proposition

* Gain hands-on experience with the technology
* A self-guided tour and sample code are provided
* Leverage, test, and / or demonstrate IBM i Merlin.
* The user is provided an OpenShift Merlin Workspace and a dedicated IBM i partition
* IBM Client Engineering for Systems team provides the infrastructure, IBM i Development provides the Merlin expertise, and you test-drive Merlin

#### Limitations

* This is not instructor led training or education
* This is not a custom PoC environment
* You are not to load HIPAA or PHI data on the IBM systems
