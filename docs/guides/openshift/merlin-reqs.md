## Required OpenShift resources

| Name                 | CPU Request | CPU Limit | Memory Request | Memory Limit | Note                              |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| Merlin               | 2.5         | 5         | 7Gi            | 15Gi         |                                   |
| IBM i Developer Tool | 0.5         | 2.7       | 1.5            | 3Gi          | The resource is per each instance |
| IBM i CI/CD          | 0.5         | 1         | 1Gi            | 2Gi          | The resource is per each instance |

> **Meaning of a instance for IBM i Developer and IBM i CI/CD tools:** If admin installs one of these two tools in a OpenShift project, that means one instance.\
> **Unit of CPU:** CPU is measured in units called millicores. If a node has 2 cores, the nodeâ€™s CPU capacity would be represented as 2000m.\
> **What is the difference between Request and Limit?** Request can be compared to the minimum amount required, where as Limit indicates the most that will be used.
